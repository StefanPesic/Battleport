# Game-Battleport-

A game made for a team school project done in Periode 2 of school year 1. The goal of the game was to have players battle each other with battleships. After the school project was over, i decided to work further on the game.

The following features are in it:
 - Shoot cannons
 - Move boats
 - Get points when a ship is down
